# (Fork) Nav2 Create 3
This is a fork of the nav2 repository for use on the Create 3 setups in the lab that has been reduced to only include changed code. Currently, the only modified part of this repo is nav2_bringup!

- this branch, humble_just_changes, is intended to be lighterweight and easier to interact with in the future in that the majority of the nav2 code which was left unchanged was removed. Note: the folders that are kept should be named create3_<original_folder_name>.

See the [nav2 repo](https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2) for more information:
